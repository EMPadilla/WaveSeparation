This is the code presented in Padilla and Alsina(2019): A general framework for wave separation in the freqeuncy doamin (submitted)

The 3 wave cases described in the paper are provided in this repository (files: ) as an example of wave separation using the presented code. Additional functions are provided with a brief description in the heading. Note that the function FUNCTION_WaveSeparation.m is the core routine that performs wave separation.
